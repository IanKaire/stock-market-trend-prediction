## Introduction
This is an stock market trend prediction application which uses a deep learning model known as L.S.T.M (Long Short Term Memory) to forecast stock prices. I picked a very big data frame for accuracy of prediction, more reason, LSTM is very accurate with long term dependencies unlike ARIMA & FaceBook Prophet. My final project


You are free to visit https://iankaire-stock-market-trend-prediction.streamlit.app/on your desktop to find the hosted version of this app. I have commented my code for ease of understanding.

Some of the libraries used include:
 
- numpy - supports large, multi-dimensional arrays along with high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
- datetime - manipulating the date and time
- pandas - working with data sets: analyzing (data analysis of relational & labeled data), cleaning, exploring and manipulating data
- matplotlib - for creating static, animated and interactive visualizations
- yfinance - provides access to the Yahoo Finance API allowing the application download historical data via stock symbols



## Kick-starting the app
If you want to work on the code, just download anaconda, then use Jupyter Notebook. You can later use Visual Studio Code to build the web application
